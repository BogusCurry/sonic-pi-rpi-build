# Debian package build process for Sonic Pi

## Sources
Much of this process was taken from the [Arch Linux community package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sonic-pi-git/).
Some of it was taken from already available Sonic Pi [Debian packages for Raspberry Pi](http://archive.raspberrypi.org/debian/pool/main/s/sonic-pi/).
Guidance was provided by Robin Newman, who created a ['community version' of Sonic Pi](https://in-thread.sonic-pi.net/t/v3-2-2-for-raspberry-pi-os-now-available/3976) of v3.2.2 that works on Raspberry Pi OS.


### TODO
* Migrate to building from debian/rpi
